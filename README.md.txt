In the world of content creation and live streaming, there's a few important factors to consider as a content creator. We've decided to hone in on viewer engagement through the use of AI technology.

VibeCatcher allows streamers to get more valuable insights on the emotions hovering around in chat. As a streamer, it's often hard to both moderate the chat and simultaneously keep track of how the chat is reacting to your content.

Detailed graphs and visualisations of data, powered by sentiment analysis technologies, give streamers the tools to give back to their community in the most entertaining way possible, or simply learn more about their audience.

Our platform would pave the way for streamers to purchase credits through a Solana Pay-powered payment portal, leveraging the power of the Solana blockchain, and allowing for transactions to execute between wallets in lightning-speed with hyper-low fees.

By integrating blockchain technologies, this creates a wide plethora of opportunities for the app to scale in both the near and far future, for example integrating stream donations which go directly towards streamer credit within the VibeCatcher platform. We hope you're interested in our platform, and that you caught our vibe!
